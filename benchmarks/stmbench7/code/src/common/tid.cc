/**

 * 
 * Definition of thread identifier generator.
 * 
 * Implemented version of thread identifier generator is very
 * simplistic, yet enough for the benchmark. If it is to be used for
 * some more general development it needs some polishing.
 * 
 * This implementation assumes that all threads will be created from
 * the same parent thread and therefore doesn't use any form of
 * synchronization for generating identifiers. Also, thread
 * initialization shouldn't be called multiple times for the same
 * thread.
